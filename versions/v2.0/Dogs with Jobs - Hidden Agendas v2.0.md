# Dogs with Jobs - Hidden Agendas v2.0

## Design Philosophy
All Hidden Agendas are binary checks at game end (Turn 12). Either you achieved it or you didn't. No tracking during the game required. Checked BEFORE position victory to allow for alternate win conditions.

## Strategy Notes

- Hidden Agendas create alternate win conditions beyond just reaching CEO
- Players must balance pursuing their agenda with preventing others from achieving theirs
- Some agendas work better with certain breeds (e.g., Token Master with breeds that generate tokens easily)
- The binary nature means no complex tracking during gameplay
- All checks happen at game end, creating tension in the final turns

## Optional Variants

### Open Agendas
- Reveal all Hidden Agendas at start
- Creates more strategic play but loses the deduction element

### Double Agendas
- Each player gets 2 Hidden Agendas
- Must achieve BOTH to win via agenda
- Increases difficulty significantly

### Veto System
- After dealing, each player may discard and redraw once
- Helps avoid impossible combinations with certain breeds
