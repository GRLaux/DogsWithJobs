# Dogs with Jobs - Breed Powers v2.0

## Design Philosophy
Each breed has ONE signature power that significantly changes how they play. Some breeds use a token system for build-up mechanics, while others have direct immediate powers.

## Breed #1: Golden Retriever
**Theme:** Everyone's best friend, people pleaser, wants everyone happy

### Power: "Good Boy Energy"

**Token System - Sympathy Tokens:**
- **Token Gain**: Receive 1 Sympathy token when you bid on a project but don't win (must play at least 1 card)
- **Token Use**: Spend 3 tokens = Climb 1 space on the ladder
- **Token Limit**: Maximum 5 tokens
- **End Game**: No penalty for unused tokens

**Special Ability - Gift Giving:**
- Once per turn during cleanup phase, may gift 1 card from hand to another player
- When you gift, gain 1 Sympathy token (cannot exceed 5)
- Creates negotiation: "I'll give you this Focus card if you don't bid on that project"

**Strategy Notes:** 
- Encourages bidding on everything to farm tokens
- Can intentionally lose small bids to bank tokens
- Gifting creates alliances and table politics
- Self-balancing: winning stops token generation from losses
